Implicit Patterns

Technologies, libraries, and frameworks use architectural
 patterns inherently which are abstracted away from developers.

Since we are using the MERN stack which has architectural patterns built-in to it
 and which are abstracted away from developers.

Here are a few that are found in our project:

NodeJS is inherently an event driven

MongoDB:

The MERN stack has many inherent architecture patterns,
 which we discuss in length in our final report.

Often technologies, libraries, and frameworks such as the MERN stack use architectural
 patterns which are built-in and abstracted away from developers.

For example, NodeJS uses the Event-Driven Architecture pattern leveraging its asynchronous nature
 and event-driven capabilities to create efficient and robust applications.

The tools we used in our project have many inherent architecture patterns,
 which we discuss in length in our final report.

I will now be handing it over to Eadan who will showcase and discuss our sequence diagrams.
